 Plant Health Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project leverages a comprehensive dataset of simulated biosensor data to predict plant health status using machine learning. The dataset includes real-time environmental, soil, and plant indicators such as soil moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, light intensity, humidity, chlorophyll content, and electrochemical signals.

🔍 Project Objective
To build accurate machine learning models that classify plant health into three categories:

Healthy ✅

Moderate Stress ⚠️

High Stress ❌

🧠 Models Used
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

🔧 Workflow
Data Exploration: Analyze feature relationships and correlations.

Model Training & Evaluation: Compare model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC.

Feature Insights: Identify key factors affecting plant health such as soil moisture, nitrogen levels, and temperature.

🎯 Outcome
A predictive tool to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early detection of plant stress and guide timely interventions for improved crop management.
